This project is for a fictional university which showcases all the vital aspects of creating a custom theme including:

+ Convert HTML templates into a real Wordpress theme
+ Creating Custom Post Types
+ Creating relationships between other content
+ Leverageing the *WP REST API*
+ Using JS to communicate with back-end on-the-fly
+ Allow users to sign in for a basic account
+ Build a 'My Notes' feature for users with real time CRUD actions and more!

This course has aided in my real life projects within my workplace and has had instant application in my day to day.

There were a few large modules covered besides the basics of wordpress such as:
+ Plugin development
+ Block, Gutneberg and building themes with *React*
+ Custom SQL database tables
+ Block Themes and full site editing
